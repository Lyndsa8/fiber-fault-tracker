# Fiber Fault Tracker

\# Fiber Fault Tracker



A simple web application to calculate and visualize \*\*fiber optic signal losses\*\*.  

This project combines my background in \*\*telecommunications (fiber splicing \& networks)\*\* with my skills in \*\*cloud deployment and software development\*\*.

\## üöÄ Project Goal

Help technicians and engineers:

\- Estimate total dB loss for a fiber link.

\- Identify high-loss regions (splices, connectors, long runs).

\- Simulate different scenarios before field deployment.



---



\## üîß Features (planned)

\- Input fiber length, number of splices, connector types, attenuation values.

\- Calculate total expected signal loss.

\- Simple visualization of the fiber link and weak points.

\- Hosted on AWS Free Tier (frontend + backend).

\- Security basics: input validation, simple authentication, logging.



---



\## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack (tentative)

\- Python (Flask) or Node.js (Express) for backend.

\- HTML/CSS/JS for frontend (lightweight, mobile-friendly).

\- AWS (S3, Lambda/API Gateway or EC2).

\- GitHub for version control and CI/CD.

\## üîç Existing Solutions \& Limitations

There are tools that help in fiber fault detection, but they come with challenges:

\- \*\*OTDR (Optical Time Domain Reflectometer):\*\*  

&nbsp; - Powerful for measuring distances and locating breaks.  

&nbsp; - Limitation: OTDR devices are expensive and not accessible for smaller ISPs or technicians.  



\- \*\*Manual Fault Logging (Excel/Reports):\*\*  

&nbsp; - Simple and low-cost.  

&nbsp; - Limitation: Error-prone, lacks automation, and cannot provide real-time tracking.  



\- \*\*SNMP Monitoring Tools:\*\*  

&nbsp; - Useful for device health monitoring.  

&nbsp; - Limitation: They don‚Äôt directly detect optical faults or physical cable issues.  	`		



\## üåü Why This Project is Different

\- \*\*Affordable and accessible:\*\* Runs on software instead of costly OTDR hardware.  

\- \*\*Centralized dashboard:\*\* Provides visualization and logs in one place.  

\- \*\*Focus on real-world faults:\*\* Designed specifically for fiber optic field technicians.  

\- \*\*Secure:\*\* Includes basic input validation, authentication, and logging.

\- \*\*Educational:\*\* Designed not only as a tool, but also as a portfolio project demonstrating telecom + cloud integration.

\## üìÖ Development Plan

\- \*\*Week 1 (Oct 1‚Äì7):\*\* Core calculation logic + local API.

\- \*\*Week 2 (Oct 8‚Äì14):\*\* Frontend + deploy to AWS.

\- \*\*Week 3 (Oct 15‚Äì21):\*\* Visualization + logging + security.

\- \*\*Week 4 (Oct 22‚Äì31):\*\* Polish + docs + LinkedIn demo.
